# Tech Lab 1: Team Collaboration Setup

*Use this document as your editable team workspace. Each section may be filled in collaboratively during the activity or afterward for submission. Between Sections 1 through 6, each team member must make at least 4 edits to this document using Git, providing a Commit message explaining briefly what the edit was and pushing your changes. For Section 7, each member must provide their own reflections.*

## 1 Client Brief

**Client:** Andrew Sandall (Aditude) \
**Project:** Oregon Ad Bidding Dataset\
**Deliverables:** 

- Identify and document issues in data as well as corrections and transformations 
- Provide a Clean dataset 
- Carry out extensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), including visualizations & summary insights 
- Share with client reproducible project folder

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 2 Team Charter

### Roles & Responsibilities (these are just some examples, create roles as you see fit)

| Role                   | Name | Responsibilities                       |
|------------------------|------|----------------------------------------|
| Project Manager        |Nick  | Coordinates work, updates board        |
| Data Engineer          |Atefeh| Manages data imports, cleaning scripts |
| Analyst / Communicator |Henry | Summarizes findings, writes reports    |

### Collaboration Policies

Specify your collaboration policies here  -- your decision-making process (e.g., majority vote tech choices, consensus deliverables), WIP limits/person, Definition of Done (e.g., documented, peer-reviewed, reproducible), who reviews the work, etc.
1) Any decisions that create conflict/disagreement will be resolved through a majority vote.
2) A task is considered "done" if it is peer-reviewed and reproducible.
3) Each team member will have no more than two active WIP items.
4) Throughout the process, it is important that we follow all data privacy and confidentiality requirements.

### Communication means and cadence

1) The primary channel of day-to-day communication will be through discord.
2) Communication will be supplemented through weekly stand-up meetings.


### Performance metrics

1) Track the average cycle time it takes from task start to task completion for each team member.
    - Increasing cycle time indicates overcommitment or unclear requirements.
2) Track the percentage of code that pass peer review without major revisions
    - Our target rate is 90% passing rate.
3) Create a biweekly anonymous survey to be completed by teammates.
    - High scores reflect a healthy team dynamic.
    
### Completion Rituals

We will write a weekly or biweekly recap for our team's progress that celebrates
completed tasks, regardless of how big or small the "win" is.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 3 Board Setup

### Columns

Backlog → To Do → In Progress → Review → Done

### Sample Tasks 

*These are just some examples, specify your own -- use some of them if you'd like*

1.  Import raw bid data from `parquet` file
2.  Check data structure and column consistency
3.  Clean missing bid prices
4.  Remove duplicates based on URL + timestamp
5.  Convert timestamps to Oregon time zone
6.  Summarize bids per advertiser
7.  Visualize bid frequency by hour of day
8.  Explore geographic bidding density
9.  Create a data dictionary
10. Write EDA summary and client memo

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 4 Daily Stand-Up Simulation Log

### Purpose

A 10-minute synchronization ritual to share progress, identify blockers,
and plan next steps.

| Team Member | Last Week     | This Week       | Blockers |
|-------------|---------------|-----------------|----------|
|     Henry   |Cloned git repo|Wrote charter    | N/A      |
|     Nick    |Cloned git repo|Made Kanban Board| N/A      |
|     Atefeh  |Cloned git repo|Pushed commit    | N/A      |

### Guidelines

-   Keep responses under 1 minute per person.
-   Discuss blockers **after** the stand-up.
-   Update the board live as items move through stages.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 5 Retrospective & Recalibration

**Discussion Prompts:** 

1. Which tasks got stuck or delayed? Why? 
2. Did your “Definition of Done” work? If not, what will you change? 
3. Were communication channels effective? 
4. How will you update your workflow
next time?

**Action Items:** 

- Adjust WIP limits or column layout. 
- Update team charter accordingly.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 6 Submission Checklist

☐ Screenshot of final Kanban board\
☐ Finalized Team Charter (with revisions)\
☐ Reflection responses (Section 5)\

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 7  Reflection Questions (Individual)

1.  What was your role and what did you learn about team coordination?
2.  How did the Kanban system help (or hinder) your progress?
3.  What’s one improvement you would apply in a real consulting project?
